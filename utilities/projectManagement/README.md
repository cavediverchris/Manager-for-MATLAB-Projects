# Project Management

This folder contains two scripts which run during project startup and shutdown respectively by setting the appropriate flag.

## Startup
This script contains functionality that is ran during the MATLAB Project startup in order to set up the environment as appropriate.

## Shutdown
This script contains functionality that is ran during the MATLAB Project shutdown in order to remove any customisations set during startup.

## Extending
If you have additional things that you want to run during startup and shutdown in order to have your development environment configured appropriate then you can simply extend the script.
