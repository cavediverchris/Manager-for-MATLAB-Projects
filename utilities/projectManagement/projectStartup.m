%% Project Set Up
% This script sets up the environment for the current MATLAB Project.
% This script needs to be added to the Shortcuts to Run at Start to ensure
% all the initialisation is conducted at project start.

%% Clear the workspace and command window
% The workspace is cleared of all current variables and all windows are
% closed this done to prevent any collisions with models or scripts that
% operate on data in the base workspace.

clc
clear variables global
close all

%% Set working directories
% In this section we will set the directory of any simulation files and any
% code generation files to be stored in a particular work directory so as
% not to clutter the working folder.
