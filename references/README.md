If you have other MATLAB Projects that this project depends on, you can use Git Submodules or SVN Externals to bring the entire MATLAB Project(s) in and have them stored in this directory. Then you can use the MATLAB Project Referencing feature to then add the referenced project(s) which will mean they will also be prepared during project startup.
